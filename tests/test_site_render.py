"""What a participant actually sees, run against real published data.

Every other test here checks what the pipeline computes. This one checks that
the page renders it. Those are different failures: `site/data.json` carried a
scored profile board for weeks while `site/leaderboard.html` read no such key,
so the board existed, was correct, and was invisible -- and a participant asked
to answer a profile round had nowhere to see whether it was scored at all.

The page's own `<script>` is executed against a small DOM (`tests/site/`), so
what is checked is the shipped code rather than a paraphrase of it. Node is
used because the page is JavaScript; when it is absent the test says so and
passes, since a participant cloning this repository to file a forecast should
not need a JavaScript runtime.
