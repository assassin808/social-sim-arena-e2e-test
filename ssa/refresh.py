    is scored against the moment it appeared. The dates cannot distinguish
    "existed at lock" from "labelled before lock"; only observation time can.

    So while a round is open every refresh overwrites its snapshot, and after

    (`freeze_for_answering`), and only falls back to the date filter for a round

    The Economist/YouGov crosstab cells are weekly waves and need no snapshot

    round scores is published after the close that froze it, so the strict `<`
